# Raymarching with shaders

## Introduction

Explain raytracing basics. Explain raymarching with distance fields. Whiteboard.

## Skeleton project for WebGL

Prepared in advance. Explain a bit.

## First example

Raymarched sphere with orthographic projection.

## Multiple spheres, position offsets

## Perspective projection

## Rotate camera

## Normals and phong lightning

## Add plane

## Different materials

## Shadows

## Soft shadows

## Fog

## Reflections

## More shapes

Show: Box, round box. Mention torus, cylinder, etc.

## Constructive Solid Geometry

Union, intersect, difference.

## Repeated geometry

## Combine repetition and CSG
